Description: PGS-TRI is for the analysis of polygenic scores (PGS) or polygenic risk scores (PRS) in case-parent trio studies for estimation of the risk of an index condition associated with direct effects of inherited PGS, indirect effects of parental PGS, and gene-environment interactions under a unified log-linear modeling framework. This tool can characterize genetic risks of diseases in the presence of population structure, assortative mating, and indirect genetic effects.
