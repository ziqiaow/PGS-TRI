}
\arguments{
\item{pgs_c}{The PGS values of the affected probands (children). A vector of length N, no missing values are allowed}

\item{pgs_m}{The PGS values of mothers that corresponds to the children. A vector of same length N, no missing values are allowed}

\item{pgs_f}{The PGS values of fathers that corresponds to the children. A vector of same length N, no missing values are allowed}

\item{side0=2}{Sided of the t test, default is 2-sided.}
}
\value{
Results of pTDT
\item{res_beta}{Results of direct PGS effect, if GxE_int is TRUE, then the result will also include PGSxE interaction effects}
