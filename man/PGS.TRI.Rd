\arguments{
\item{pgs_offspring}{The PGS values of the affected probands (children). A vector of length N, no missing values are allowed}

\item{pgs_mother}{The PGS values of mothers that corresponds to the children. A vector of same length N, no missing values are allowed}

\item{pgs_father}{The PGS values of fathers that corresponds to the children. A vector of same length N, no missing values are allowed}

\item{GxE_int}{Whether there are interaction effect between pgs and environmental variables that are of interest in the model. If FALSE, then "formula" and "E" are ignored.}

\item{parental_indirect}{Whether to estimate potential parental indirent effect, returns an estimated difference of mother and father parental effect (delta_MF = beta_M - beta_F).}

\item{formula}{The environmental variables of interest for the PGSxE interaction effect}

\item{E}{The environmental variables of interest for interaction effect. A vector of length N for one environmental variable or a data frame/data matrix of NxP for P environmental variables are allowed.}

\item{side}{Sided of the Wald test, default is 2-sided.}

\item{smalltriosize}{Whether number of trios is small (<100), if TRUE, a t test will be used rather than a wald test.}
}
\value{
A list of results of PGS.TRI
\item{res_beta}{Results of direct PGS effect, if GxE_int is TRUE, then the result will also include PGSxE interaction effects}
\item{res_delta}{Results of indirect parental PGS effect difference: PGS_mother - PGS_father}
\item{var_fam}{Within-family variances for each family}
\item{var_fam_sum}{Sum of within-family variances}
